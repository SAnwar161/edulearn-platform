# GitHub Upload Commands Template

# STEP 1: Replace YOUR_USERNAME with your actual GitHub username
# Your GitHub username is what appears in your GitHub profile URL
# For example: https://github.com/johndoe → username is "johndoe"

git remote add origin https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/edulearn-platform.git

# STEP 2: Verify the remote was added
git remote -v

# STEP 3: Push your code to GitHub
git push -u origin master

# You'll be asked for your GitHub username and password/token
# If you have 2-factor authentication, use a Personal Access Token instead of password
